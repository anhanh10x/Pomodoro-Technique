# Introduction to Pomodoro Technique Timer

**Welcome to the Pomodoro Technique Timer, a productivity tool designed to help you stay focused, boost productivity, and take well-deserved breaks while working or studying.**

**How It Works:**

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages short, focused work sessions (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. This cycle is repeated to maximize your efficiency. Here's how our timer can assist you:
 - Set Your Task: Begin by setting the task you want to work on. Whether it's a project, study session, or any other task that requires your attention, this timer will help you stay on track.
 - Focus Mode (25 Minutes): Click "Start" to begin a 25-minute focus session, known as a "Pomodoro." During this time, stay fully concentrated on your task, and the timer will count down.
 - Short Break (5 Minutes): After completing a Pomodoro, enjoy a well-deserved 5-minute break. Use this time to stretch, relax, or recharge.
 - Repeat or Long Break: Once you've completed a set number of Pomodoros (e.g., 4), you can take a longer break (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to rest and rejuvenate. Then, you can start a new cycle.

**Automatic Screen Off:**
 - As an added feature to promote relaxation during your breaks, our Pomodoro Timer can automatically turn off your screen when your break begins. This encourages you to step away from your computer, reducing eye strain and encouraging physical activity during breaks.
